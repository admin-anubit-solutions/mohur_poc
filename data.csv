Medical colleges need to reinvent themselves so they can give the young ,intelligent, technically-savvy medical students who are passionate abouthealthcare an opportunity to come up with innovative solutions which allowthem to take care of patients on a much larger scale than doctors did in thepast.We need to upgrade medical education to create a new generation of doctors whoare future-ready. This is why the Medical Innovation and Entrepreneurship Lab,launched on Sept 5 2018 ( Teacherâ€™s Day) at J J Hospital,Mumbai.This is a hands-on Tinkering Lab and maker space for medical students, whichwill encourage doctors and medical students to do things with their own hands,so they can create solutions to indigenous problems.Such a lab would provide for cross-disciplinary collaboration. Medicalstudents could talk to engineers, psychologists, sociologists, senior doctors,patients and designers under one roof, so that perspectives from differentfields could be blended together to create brand new solutions which are co-created for Indian conditions.Doctors are very well positioned to create solutions to medical problems .Doctors understand the pain points of patients, so that the solutions theyprovide will be practical and feasible, and can be implemented easilyaccording to the Indian scenario.We need to catch them young, and help them togrow. This would also be very energizing for senior doctors. They would havean opportunity to see some of their innovations come to light, as theyinteract with engineers and technocrats, and this would be a great way ofmaking use of their extensive clinical expertise.Medical colleges do already collaborate with pharma companies when doingclinical research - they need to start thinking on a much bigger scale now, sothey can partner with IT companies and medical device manufacturers as well !So our aim is to collaborate and partner with organizations like yours thattake lead and a step towards training and mentoring a new breed of doctors.Our website is www.micelabs.in.",,,,"[{'firstName': 'C ', 'lastName': 'KrishnaChaitanya', 'designation': 'Lead Mentor', 'emailId': 'krishna@micelabs.in', 'mobileNumber': '8657134618', 'landlineNumber': None, 'website': None, 'socialMediaAccountURL': None}]",[]

ETHICAL MODEL OF VCCI is based on legendary Chanakyaâ€™s verses (Kautilya Sutras) on Propounded Actions, Ethos and Philosophical Underpinning of Management. Also, our Projects are based on thought process of â€œRebuild Indiaâ€ by Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose and Swami Vivekanand; this makes us quite different than other Chambers of Commerce or Associations.    4.    To perform organized MSME development activities, we sort and treat our members or prospects based on their stages viz. Seed, Start Up, Scale Up, Expansion and Maturity. Our programs are uniquely developed based on Kautilya Sutras as follows:  A.    ETHICS AND MANAGEMENT TRAINING through â€œNishchay.todayâ€: According toChanakya, Basis of Accomplishment of Set of Tasks is Ethics (Sukhasya MulamDharmah, where we consider that, â€Sukhaâ€ for any Entrepreneur isAccomplishment of Set of Tasks and â€œDharmahâ€ means Set ofEthics/Constitution/Code of Conduct of Company). The training programs orsessions are further classified in two parts viz. â€œPre-Establishment Trainingâ€and â€œPost-Establishment Trainingâ€.  B.    RESOURCE AND INFORMATION SERVICE THROUGH â€œERIAâ€ (ERIA - EssentialResource and Information Allocation): According to Chanakya, Basis of Ethicsis Resources (Dharmasya Mulam Arthah, where we consider â€œDharmaâ€œ is Set ofEthics and â€œArthâ€ as Resources). The information allocation (related toBusiness, Strategies and Schemes of Government etc.) would be a supplementaryservice with Resources.  C.    BUSINESS ESTABLISHMENT through VCCIâ€™s â€œDistrict Committeesâ€: Accordingto Chanakya, Basis of Resources is Kingdom (Arthasya Mulam Rajyam, where weconsider that, â€œArthâ€ as Resources and â€œKingdomâ€ is VCCI including ourDistrict Committees and Members). Becoming Resourceful is most important partin business establishment process, and is necessary to take actions to makefruitful investment, deals, and bonding. At VCCI, we establish two DistrictCommittees categorized for â€œMicro and Small Enterprisesâ€ and â€œMedium and LargeEnterprisesâ€, through this channel the businesses and traders will come underunified environment to accomplish any task, arbitration and conciliationrequirements or â€œNeed-Doâ€ interaction will take place.  The following services will be voluntarily supplemented through DistrictCommittees â€“  I.    Registration of Company  II.    Licensing  III.    Registration at Government Portals or Flagship Schemes  IV.    Business Valuation, Verification and Inspection  V.    Arbitration and Conciliation  D.    WEALTH CREATION and EMPLOYMENT through â€œDistrict Committeesâ€: Accordingto Chanakya, Basis of Kingdom is Conquering on Bodily Organs (Rajyasya MulamIndriya Jayah, where we consider, â€œKingdomâ€ is â€œVCCI Familyâ€ and â€œIndriyaâ€ asâ€œMembersâ€). The main ideology here is to avail underpinning management ethosby organizing experts, veterans, skilled workers for businesses whichobviously led to wealth creation and employment at District Levels.  E.    SPECIAL PROGRAMS through â€œDistrict Committeesâ€: According to Chanakya,Conquering of Bodily Organs is rooted in Humility (Indriya Jayasya MulamVinayah, where we consider, â€œIndriyaâ€ as Members and â€œVinayaâ€ is â€œSet ofprograms to be followed by membersâ€). To bring this about, VCCIâ€™s DistrictCommittees will run following supplementary programs for establishedbusinesses in unique way:  I.    Mind Development Programs (MDPs): MDPs are further classified in twoways  1.     Sequential Mental Health Development (SMHD) - Monthly  2.     Competitive and Challenge Contests (CCC) â€“ Quarterly  II.    Entrepreneurial Intellect Development Program (EIDP): This program willhelp urban and semi urban entrepreneurs to learn about business ethos and howcode of conduct should be made in accordance to be successful in business.Recent study showed that lack of intellectual capabilities led to failure ofstartups and this is big problem at village level entrepreneurs who donâ€™t haveproper resource to get training before they start business, thought ofâ€œBusiness is very risky thing to doâ€ or â€œBusiness is not for ordinary peopleâ€is a result of having no intellect about how business is properly done.  To run MDPs, VCCI can also make alliances with similar non profitorganizations who run unique programs e.g. Brahma Kumaris organization runYogik Kheti, VCCI can make alliance to avail this kind of program tointerested agripreneurs through MDP.  F.    WEB BASED COUNSELLING through â€œERIA â€“ Essential Resource and InformationAllocationâ€: According to Chanakya, Root of Humility is in the serving ofelders (Vinayasya Mulam Vruddhopseva, where we consider Vinaya as â€œSet ofProgramsâ€ and â€œVruddhopsevaâ€ as serving to learned or veteran experts). ERIAcan be door opening for EXPERTS and GOVERNMENT EXECUTIVES to express theirwordily knowledge and avail counseling to entrepreneurs or prospects in singleeffort. This will also save time and energy on different subjects for multiplelocations; however common subjects can be repeatedly delivered in targetlocations. Here, a part of ERIA will perform e-  ",,,,"[{'firstName': 'Pravin', 'lastName': 'Mane', 'designation': 'Secretary', 'emailId': 'admin@vidhimanya.com', 'mobileNumber': '8412838503', 'landlineNumber': None, 'website': 'www.vidhimanya.com', 'socialMediaAccountURL': None}]",[]

While teaching children, He realized the gaps in the education system. Theblood donation camps led him to educational institutions for volunteers. In ashort span of time, he developed a very strong rapport with several students,teachers, parents and educational administrators. While talking to them, itcame to his mind that many students today are not socially very much engaged.  After doing some research, He realized that individualism and consumerism isdeveloping because of a very structured education system which hardly has roomfor questioning, experiential learning  and freedom of thought. Right from theschool days students are made to think in a very structured manner with an eyeon the final exams.    As an entrepreneur, He actually realized that the youth has a lot of creativeenergy and talent. However, most of them are unable to channelize their energyproperly due to non-immersive education system. According to him, in order toput in their best, the youth must discover their own strengths and utilizethem to create economic and social values.  Using the methodology of experiential learning & thought based approach, Monishas successfully worked with stakeholders in the development sector to createa meaningful learning journey for the youth, based on self-exploration anddiscovery. His idea is also to ensure that the youth utilizes such learningexperiences to enhance their own career goals.",,,,,['TIE_REGISTERED']

A couple of innovative business ideas were conceived and executed during allthese years.  For example, a B2B chemicals exchange was set up in 1999, pricediscovery model for pre-owned items for every household, an 'internet retail'network of existing Mom & Pop stores in smaller towns of India by expandingtheir shelf space thru virtual inventory of thousands of SKUs, a low-costzero-risk business model for India's small and micro retailers which canenhance their level of income by 30%+, cut down the cost and time in 'go-to-market' for brands drastically and unlimited geo- reach and so on...    And now mentoring another project of providing a green mobility solution forcommon people - bike (bicycle) sharing giving solution to first mile/last mileand short distance (less than 2 km) travel problem.  It has been a great exciting, and challenging journey.

I make no assumptions about your potential or limitations so I listen verycarefully and absorb your needs, values and aspirations.    I trust my instincts, skills, experience and intelligence as tools that canhelp you to be successful. I also have a huge (and growing) toolbox of methodsand ideas to share. I love to learn, and I draw on a wide variety of sourcesto find ideas that really work.    I believe in working in partnership along the path towards your success,although you must take your own decisions and make your own commitment toaction. This means that in the end everything that you achieve belongscompletely to you.    I like to have some fun along the way. I like to ask questions that cause youto think and see things in new ways. I have a heart as well as a brain and getpassionate about what I do whilst maintaining objectivity and professionalism.    I thrive on seeing people create much better futures for themselves, andespecially during those â€œlight bulbâ€ moments when they suddenly see, feel orunderstand things in a new way.    My approach is holistic and most importantly, is focussed around your goalsand values. It is after all, your business.    It has been described as ""a personal trainer for business"".    I find that most people love what they do. They provide amazing services. Butthey donâ€™t necessarily fully understand how to run their business, and theythink something must be wrong with them personally.    Nothingâ€™s wrong with them! Itâ€™s just that no one has ever taught them what todo!    The old model of business is â€œwork hard and get people to buy your stuff.â€ Thenew model is Authenticity, Service and Wealth.    When you learn to create your business in the new model, people thank you forbeing successful. They thank you for who you are and what youâ€™ve created. (Youget to thank them too!)

Within 3 months1400+ Doctors from 110 countries joined docntalk and 150+ research wereuploaded by them. Later Apurv sold the portal in international markets. Well,technology was a big challenging factor in earlier days for Apurv Modi as itwas very difficult to choose the right kind of technology which fulfills thethree important factors ie time, scalability and money but with his sheerdetermination somehow he managed to utilize the correct technology.  In 2012, Apurv Modi started ATechnos with the support of his family and hisbrother Abhinav Jain, who acted as a source of motivation in his life. Healways pushed Apurv to be a pathbreaking worker in business and always be aninspiration for the coming generation. In the initial two years of his careerApurv was also associated with other companies as well. Finally on 1st January2015, he disembodied himself from all the other ventures and dedicated himselfcompletely to ATechnos. ATechnos has started with content distribution,channel distribution, media celeb, media buying and entered into contentproduction. Apurv has also launched other online businesses likePostpaidconnect.com, Food Delivery App. A new vertical launched in the year2017 called Campaign Planet which has all the services related to telecomsolutions by his brother Abhinav Jain who later joined the company.

The seed of entrepreneurship was already inculcated within Apurv as heinherited this quality from his father who was also a businessman but to builda company on his own and take it to a new height requires a pragmatic visionto deal with circumstances. His hard work with devotion is simplyinexplicable. His outlandish approach have made this company what it is todayand still making its path in the field of business which is really inspiringfor the business people as well as the youth of the country.",,,(Atechnos - URL: www.atechnos.com) | ,,[]

To address this gap, I stepped out ofthe corporate world and started 'OASiS - A Social Innovations Lab' in India,in 2003. Innovating new approaches and models for development, my models havesolved long standing problems and issues like Social Security for rural, urbanand differently-abled, Education â€“ Urban and Rural, Community livelihoods,Youth development , etc. Elected an Ashoka Fellow in 2004, and having won manyinternational innovation awards, my models are being replicated by Government,NGOs, Universities and schools. Our model called â€˜The Museum Schoolâ€™ wonUNESCOâ€™s Education Innovation Award for 2016. Budding social entrepreneursmentored by our Lab have received national acclaim. I am now replicating theSocial Innovation Lab internationally, through Universities, and grassrootstoo.While most Startup Incubators provide support to promising ideas, there is noIncubator that helps an individual develop an idea itself. OASiS with its in-house designed approaches to social innovation, fills this gap by supportingits Mentees from â€˜Ideation to Institutionâ€™. Equipped with three decades ofCorporate and Social sector experience, I am also a co-Founder at AIC-Aartech,Bhopal.At this age, I still nurture the heart of a child, and get excited with everynew idea. I believe in and follow George Bernard Shawâ€™s quote: You see things;and you say 'Why?' But I dream things that never were; and I say 'Why not?â€™.",,,(OASiS - A Social Innovations Lab - URL: www.oasisorg.in) | (The Museum School - providing quality education to out-of-school slum children through Museums - URL: www.themuseumschool.in ) | ,,[]

Ltd, Hyderabad. After that I was joined as research scholar, I continuedmy research in the field of Clinical Biochemistry project entitle â€œAssessmentof anti-asthmatic activity of â€˜pentapala-04â€™ (a poly herbal drug) andapplication of vermitechnology for the growth of selected medicinal plantsâ€.Developing countries can ill afford the products of the Western pharmaceuticalindustry due to their high and rising cost. The import of such medicines orpayment of royalties for local manufacture of the medicine causes a heavyfinancial burden to the developing countries. The World Health Organization,therefore, recommends the inclusion of herbal medicines which are time tested,safe and available at affordable prices in the national health programmes(Souza et al., 1998). Moreover, traditional medicines show better cultureacceptability, better compatibility and lesser side effects than syntheticdrugs. This recognition has made the herbal system once again the center stageof health care programme, not only in India, but the world over (Banerjee etal., 1999). Hence, we can make rural primary health care service effective torevive and promote traditional health practice based on the use of judiciouscombination of medicinal plant extracts.  A vast number of medicinal plants have been used traditionally in theayurvedic system of medicine for the management of asthma (Srinivasarao etal., 2006). Thus, the present study involves the use of plant extracts fromvarious parts of five medicinal plants namely Adhatoda vasica, Ocimum sanctum,Coleus aromaticus, Glycyrrhiza glabra and Alpinia galanga in the preventionand curation of ova albumin and aluminium hydroxide induced lung damage inrats. Earthworms can consume partially all kinds of organic wastes, consumetwo to five times its body weight and excrete mucus coated undigested matteras nutrient rich worm casts or vermicasts (Isamil, 2003). Vermicasts are richsource of macro and micronutrients, vitamins, minerals, thus it improves soilstructure, physico-chemical properties and act excellent soil amendments(Julka and Paliwal, 2005). Medicinal plants have their medicinal values in thesecondary metabolites present in various plant tissues. Therefore, plants weregrown with application of vermicompost and studied the content of secondarymetabolites present in them.Thus, our research work has been proposed to explore the potential ofvermicasts to emphasis the quantity of secondary metabolites in medicinalplants which, inurn increase their pharmaceutical value. With this research Iwas published more than 30 papers in International Journals.In 2008 I was allotted as a Guide for the Doctoral students at this stage,Ph.D Student K. Vijaya Sudhkar completed the work on â€œPreparation andCharatrization heparin stabilized silver nanopartilces for the treatment ofIsoprene induced cardiac Diseases in rats, (Funded Project File No: F.14-2(SC)/2009 (SA-III).
